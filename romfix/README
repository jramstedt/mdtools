Mega Drive ROM fixer utility
© 2018 Javier Degirolmo
Version 1.0

This program is meant to be run after an assembler or compiler generates
the ROM file. It does some additional maintenance job like padding the ROM
or fixing some information in the ROM header. It's an useful addition to
complement your current tools.

This utility is released under the zlib license.

;----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The program is run as follows:

   romfix «options» «filename.bin»

Running the program as-is (even without options) will do the following:

   * The checksum is calculated and fixed in the ROM header.
   
   * The ROM will be padded to the next size deemed "safe". This is useful
     to avoid issues with some old emulators or flashcarts that could mistake
     it for a .smd file in edge cases, or in case your assembler doesn't
     align the ROM to a word size for whatever reason.

;----------------------------------------------------------------------------

On top of that, passing arguments to the command line (see «options») lets
you do some additional operations on the ROM:

   -t "GAME TITLE GOES HERE"
   
      Changes the game title in the ROM header (both domestic and overseas
      fields). Title must be up to 48 characters long, will be padded with
      spaces if it's shorter.
   
   -c "XYZW"
   
      Changes the four-letter copyright code in the ROM header. If the code
      is shorter than four characters, it'll be padded with spaces.
   
   -d
   
      Changes the date in the copyright field to today.
   
   -s "BLAHBLAH"
   
      Changes the serial number. It must be up to 8 characters long, it will
      be padded with spaces if shorter. Try to pick an unlikely serial number
      (e.g. maybe your copyright code + a suffix? whatever works)
   
   -r 00
   
      Changes the revision number. It must be between 00 and 99. It
      *must* be two digits (e.g. you can't do -r 1, instead do -r 01)
   
   -z
   
      Reports the size of the ROM before and after padding (to stderr).

;----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Also (without passing a ROM file):

   romfix -h ... show usage
   romfix -v ... show version
